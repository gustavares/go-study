##### What are the main features of the grep command?
The grep command is a powerful tool used for searching and filtering text data in Unix-based operating systems. Some of the main features of the grep command include:

Search for patterns: The grep command searches for specific patterns in a file or output stream and prints out the lines that match those patterns. You can search for words, phrases, or patterns of characters within a file or output stream.

Regular expression support: grep supports the use of regular expressions for pattern matching. This allows for more advanced and flexible searches.

Case-insensitive search: You can use the -i option with grep to perform a case-insensitive search, meaning that the search will match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Recursive search: With the -r or -R option, grep can search for a pattern recursively in all files and directories within a given directory.

Inverted search: You can use the -v option to perform an inverted search, which means that grep will print out all lines that do not match the pattern.

Line number display: You can use the -n option to print the line numbers of the matched lines.

Multiple file search: You can use the grep command to search for a pattern in multiple files by specifying the file names as command line arguments or using wildcards.

Pipe support: grep can be used in combination with other commands by piping the output of one command into grep as input.
